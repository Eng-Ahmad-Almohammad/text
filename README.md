## Headings
### HTML has six "levels" of headings:
#### 1-< h1 > is used for main headings.
#### 2-< h2 > is used for subheadings.
#### 3- If there are further sections under the subheadings then the < h3 > element is used, and so on...

## Paragraphs
## < p >
### To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening < p > tag and closing < /p > tag.
## Bold & Italic
## < b >
### By enclosing words in the tags < b > and < /b > we can make characters appear bold.
## < i >
### By enclosing words in the tags < i > and < /i > we can make characters appear italic.
## Superscript & Subscrip
## < sup >
### The < sup > element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
## < sub >
### The < sub > element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such.

## White Space
### In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.
### When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.
## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
## < br />
### As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag < br />.
## < hr />
### To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the < hr /> tag.
